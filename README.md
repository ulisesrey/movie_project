# programming_data_science_pac4
This program was written to analyze the TMBD and extract some meaningful data from it. 



## Description
Important: Do not copy nor write any csv file into data folder, as the code will not work properly. The data folder should only contain csv files that belong to a same "dataset" and share and id column.
If you need to have some csv files within the project write/copy them elsewhere, like in reports/data/ or dev/data/.
## Installation
### Requirements
Can they be installed with the package with pip install?

### Install it as a package
add git clone?
```bash
cd package_directory
pip install .
```
## Run
All together
separate

Might need to be run from the main folder.
Try
```bash
python movie_project/main.py
```
and
```bash
cd movie_project
python main.py #this might not work
```
### Input

### Output

To improve: The exercise explicitly asks for questions like: What is the evolution of types of movie per decade?
Althought the functions have been written to be able to answer to questions more broadly, the specific answer to these questions is hard coded in the main.py output.

## Reports
The report for this exercise can be found in reports/pac4_report.md

## Run tests
A unit test has been written to test if the code works properly.
To run it do:
