## Description
Important: Do not copy nor write any csv file into data folder, as the code will not work properly. The data folder should only contain csv files that belong to a same "dataset" and share and id column.
If you need to have some csv files within the project write/copy them elsewhere, like in reports/data/ or dev/data/.

### Output

To improve: The exercise explicitly asks for questions like: What is the evolution of types of movie per decade?
Althought the functions have been written to be able to answer to questions more broadly, the specific answer to these questions is hard coded in the main.py output.

The report for this exercise can be found in reports/pac4_report.md
